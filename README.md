#### Course Description 

This course makes use of software engineering concepts to introduce practical web application development. Topics covered include the development environment, version control, unit testing, deployment strategies, the role of object-orientated programming in web frameworks and best practices for web scale. In this hands-on class, students will work on a semester-long project in order to further understand these core concepts. Prior programming experience with an object-orientated language is required. The course will make use of Laravel, a PHP framework.

#### Course Objectives
- Develop the methodical skills necessary for producing web applications.
- Become familiar with the web development tools and environment setup.
- Apply object-orientated principals to build web applications.
- Provide you with fundamental skills to help you learn new web application tools and frameworks more quickly.

#### Participation

You are encouraged to ask as questions. While some people will enjoy asking questions out loud, others might feel more comfortable asking questions via messaging platform. I will be monitoring a Slack (nyu.slack.com) #cs6015 channel during each lecture.


At the beginning of each lecture, I will pick one person’s programming assignment code, and will ask one random student to explain what it does. The idea behind this is to develop important skill of working with others’ code.
